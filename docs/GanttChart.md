##Spring Week 4
![Gantt1](images/gantt/Week1WP0.png)

- At this point in the project, we were deciding what code base to take over for assessment 2.
- We spent most of the week researching and testing other games to decide on which would be the easiest to take over
and the easiest to implement our desired requirements into.
- At this point everyone was present and a plan was being formed for the team by Hubert to have a general idea of timelines and 
tasks that had to be done before the project started properly. The gantt chart was created and minutes had started to be taken to
later verify what had been completed. The plan consisted of a base timeline for when aspects of assessment 2 were to be completed; this 
was further developed in the following weeks becoming more sophisticated after a specific code base was selected and the tasks were adjusted to the needs of the project.
- No risks were encountered since everyone was present and the risks had not yet been properly identified and analysed. The risk identification, analysis 
and mitigation would come in the following weeks after project selection. 
- At this point we completed our first work package and reached our first project milestone.

##Spring week 5

- In this week we focused on analysing the project that we selected, Team Triple10.
- After taking over the project, we managed to communicate with Triple10 to fully take over their documents since not all were easily accessible on their website.
	- Having the risk documentation being updated early in the project as mentioned in the base plan meant that we were able to identify, assign ownership and mitigate such risks and
 prevent them from hurting our project. This risk was R2.19, having difficulties in taking over Triple10's website. We were able to mitigate this by changing the style of the website from HTML to MKDocs to better suit our experience, 
and liasing with the previous team to retrieve all their previous documentation to continue our work and prevent our project from becoming stagnant.
-  We continued to otherwise become familair with Triple10's documentation, which allowed us to analyse their methods and adjust them where needed to fit our needs and experience from our previous assessment.
- Additonally, we created a change log that allowed us to log our changes and justifications as required by the brief, also giving us a history of our updates to look back on when needed.
- After this, we were able to accelerate with out project since we implemented the infrastructure to take over the project smoothly as if it was our own.
- No further risks were encountered since everyone was present and it was too early in the project to encounter any other risks that were associated with adjusting methods and changing documentation.

##Spring Week 6

- Sam Toner was not present for the meetings during this week. 
	- To mitigate risk R2.1 we took meeting minutes (which are accessible by all team members) 
and updated him on what happened at the end of the week.

- Requirements document update had to be moved to the end of the week to ensure that further requirements were added as they were not detailed enough; 
	- This follows the mitiagtion for risk R2.9 since we allowed malleable deadlines so we could extend task duration as needed.
	- It also follows the mitigation for risk R2.13 since after quality assurance we decided that we needed to add more requirements and be more clear about what was needed
	- It also follows the mitiagtion for risks R2.20 and R2.21 because there were not enough requirements to accuractely describe the system as well as discovering new requirements needed for assessment 2 throughout the week
- Current code base evaluation had to be extended so that the code base could be better understood and the improvements on the code base could be better planned out by the development team
	- This followed the mitigation for Risk R.18

- Another risk encountered by not keeping up to date with the change log, must keep up to date with it and ensure that the changes are logged
	- This follows the mitigation for risk R2.13 as we ensured that all changes were logged and enforce quality assurance more often to prevent it happeneing again
- Have changed the end date of the unit test plan, required more time since we wanted to make it easier to read and interact with and so it took longer; also added further tests to the plan
	- This also followed the mitigation for risk R2.13 as we wanted to have a more detailed template to use when starting to write tests
	- Additionally it followed the mitigation for risk R2.9 as we changed the plan

- Personal issues meant power up and recipe displays got delayed until the end of the project
	- This followed the mitigation for Risk R2.31 as we has a minumum bus factor of 2, 
	meaning someone monitored the task and took on some of the workload themselves until the original owner continued work on it.
- As a result this also delayed a lot of additional deadlines especially for documentation which had to be extended to the end of the project
	- Due to this, we had to adapt the plan to ensure that everything would be completed in time after the delay. This follows the mitigation for risk R2.9
