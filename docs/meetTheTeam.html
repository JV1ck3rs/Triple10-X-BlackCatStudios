                We are a team of computer scientists from the Univeristy of York.
                Over the course of the last couple of terms we have been meeting
                regularly to complete and develop our own game inspired by
                overcooked. On this website you can find all the information about
                our development cycle that you'll need as well as an insight into
                how we went about creating our game. Hope you enjoy your stay!
