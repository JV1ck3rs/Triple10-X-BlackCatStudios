The website was previously made up of html documents. Team 27 decided to convert the documents to markdown and use material for mkdocs to build the page. This has been done because the team already had experience with mkdocs as we used it for our website for assessment 1 and because html can be used directly in markdown. Mkdocs provides useful functionality which make the website easier to create and use.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#files","text":"","title":"Files"},{"location":"#assessment-1","text":"Type of File Link Jar File JAR Requirements Req1 Architecture Arch1 Method Selection and Planning Plan1 Risk Assessment Risk1 Implementation Impl1 GitHub Repository (Assessment 1) Repo","title":"Assessment 1"},{"location":"#assessment-2","text":"Type of File Link GitHub Repository (Assessment 2) Repo","title":"Assessment 2"},{"location":"#website-changes","text":"Team 27 (BlackCatStudios) has taken over Team 30's (Triple10) website and game.
