The gantt chart was created and minutes had started to be taken to later verify what had been completed.

This risk was R2.19, having difficulties in taking over Triple10's website. We were able to mitigate this by changing the style of the website from HTML to MKDocs to better suit our experience,  and liasing with the previous team to retrieve all their previous documentation to continue our work and prevent our project from becoming stagnant.</li> </ul> </li> <li>We continued to otherwise become familair with Triple10's documentation, which allowed us to analyse their methods and adjust them where needed to fit our needs and experience from our previous assessment.</li> <li>Additonally, we created a change log that allowed us to log our changes and justifications as required by the brief, also giving us a history of our updates to look back on when needed.</li> <li>After this, we were able to accelerate with out project since we implemented the infrastructure to take over the project smoothly as if it was our own.</li> <li>The new code base had also undergone its first evaluation; this aided in further planning of the project since we were able to find out further what was needed to be modified in the code base. This heavily influenced the gantt chart and planning, allowing Hubert to better adjust the team plan to the project.</li> <li>We were able to additionally create our repository and integrate our continous integration to ensure that we were keeping with the project brief.

While the risks, requirements and method selection and planning documentation was continuously updated, our development team continued to learn the code base and began improving and implementing new functionality for the game.

Due to our method selection, we had a malleable plan which was able to be adjusted by a few days to give individuals the leniency they needed.</li> <li>No other issues were encountered and the project continued otherwise as normal.

Vickers was also implemting the user inferface. We were making siginicant progress towards our goal of finish some essential components before the easter holiday. </li> <li>One risk we were overcoming was R2.17 as it wasn't clear if we could use the previous teams license at this point and the team was debating purchasing it ourself to prevent legal issues. </li> <li>R2.13 was another issue as some core elements weren't able to be play tested thus we had unidentified bugs in the code at that moment.

The other risk is R2.23, due to the fact we would be seperated for the next few weeks, development might end up going off on a tangent.

R2.9 was especialy prevalent in these weeks for this reason and so the Gantt Chart and the plan underwent significant modification to allow for all these changes and needs of the team members. Sam needed extra time to finish his power up implementation and UI, as well as his architectural documentation updates and so needed an extension to the end of the project. The same was required for testing and bug fixes for the entire code base since more and more bugs were continuously found. Manual tests were especially needed towards the end of the project and so not only was the deadline extended, but a higher bus factor was implemented to ensure that it was not forgotten.</li> <li>R2.13 was a serious risk that had to be considered in this case and we needed to make sure that we were aware of our contingency plan of good communication, honesty and teamwork as well as quality assurance to ensure that the quality of our work was not suffering.</li> <li>We further encountered code style and naming convention issues which had to be fixed and later added to the gantt chart due to R2.14 as an extra task. We knew this was an issue from our assessment 1 feedback and so made sure that this was rectified before the project was handed in. </li> <li>We were also able to test the game on different operating systems ensuring that it ran on Linux and MacOS as well as Windows which was a success.</li> <li>R2.32 was also improved upon by increasing the output of the tests that we were doing since we wanted this to be higher. We therefore had to extend our deadline on the completion of tests till the end of the project to increase our coverage.</li> <li>At this point, after a larger workload regarding the project and a lot of updates occurring in the gantt chart, we were able to complete the project and successfully hand it in in time; we were satisfied with out work and happy to meet all the requirements as well as complete the work to the best of our ability. This was further verified by quality assurance at the end of the project of all work.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Licenses/","title":"Main Asset:","text":"<p>Credits required: https://limezu.itch.io/  Modern Interiors is a paid asset brought by the previous team Triple10.
